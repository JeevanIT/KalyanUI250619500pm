<p>According to Sacnilk, the movie made Rs 10.7 crore on day 1. On the second day, it minted Rs 20.2 crore which was a growth of around 88.79 percent. Meanwhile, the Sunday number were even better as the film garnered Rs 27.25 crore. It's natural that the film will see some drop in numbers on Monday as it's a weekday. However, the early numbers till afternoon seem decent. 'Sitaare Zameen Par' made Rs 2.85 crore till Monday afternoon and the film's total collection so far now stands at Rs 61 crore.</p>
<p>Directed by Advait Chandan, 'Sitaare Zameen Par' is a remake of the 2019 Spanish film 'Campeones'. The film stars Aamir Khan, who plays a basketball coach who trains a team of intellectually disabled players. The film has received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, which has contributed to its strong box office performance.</p>

<p>As per the early estimates, the film is expected to collect around Rs 4.5 crore on Monday, which will take its total collection to around Rs 65.5 crore. This is a good number for a film that was released on a non-holiday weekend and faced competition from other films like 'Fighter' and 'Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan'.</p>
<p>Overall, 'Sitaare Zameen Par' has had a strong opening weekend and is expected to continue performing well at the box office. The film's positive word of mouth and strong performances by the cast have contributed to its success.</p>
<p>In conclusion, 'Sitaare Zameen Par' has had a strong opening weekend at the box office, with a total collection of around Rs 61 crore.

<p>
How it fares on Monday and all through the week will play an important role in knowing the film's fate at the box office. But looks like the film has now caught on really well with positive word of mouth and there's no looking back.

It is doing better in multiplexes than single screens though which is expected from an Aamir movie and especially a film of this sort.</p>
